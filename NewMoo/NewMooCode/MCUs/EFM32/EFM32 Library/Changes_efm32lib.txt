================ Revision history ============================================
1.3.0:
 - MSC is automatically enabled/disabled when using the MSC API. This saves
   power, and reduces errors due to not calling MSC_Init().
 - Added API for controlling Cortex-M3 MPU (memory protection unit)
 - Adjusted bit fields to comply with latest CMSIS release, see EFM_CMSIS
   changes file for details
 - Fixed issue with bit mask clearing in ACMP
 - Functions ACMP_Enable and ACMP_DisableNoReset added
 - Added comment about rev.C chips in PCNT, CMD_LTOPBIM not neccessary any more
 - Added missing instance validity asserts to peripherals (ACMP, LEUART, USART)
 - Fixed UART0 check in CMU_ClockFreqGet()
 - Fixed command sync for PCNT before setting TOPB value during init
 - Fixed instance validity check macro in PCNT
 - Fixed TIMER_Reset() removed write to unimplemented timer channel registers
 - Fixed EFM_ASSERT statements in ACMP, VCNP  
 - General code style update: added missing curly braces, default cases, etc.

1.2.1:
 - Feature complete efm32lib, now also includes peripheral API for modules
   AES,PCNT,MSC,ACMP,VCMP,LCD,EBI 
 - Fixed _TIMER_CC_CTRL_ICEDGE flags for correct timer configuration
 - Fixed ADC calibration of Single and Scan mode of operation
 - Added PCNT (ChipRev A/B PCNT0 errata NOT supported) and AES support
 - Fixed conditional inclusion in efm32_emu.h
 - Fixed code for LEUART0 for devices with multiple LEUARTs.
 - Fixed incorrect setting of DOUT for GPIO configuration

1.1.4
 - Fix for TIMER_INIT_DEFAULT
 
1.1.3:
 - Added ADC, DAC, LETIMER, PRS, TIMER (except DTI) support
 - Added utility for fetching chip revision (efm32_system.c/h)
 - Removed RTC instance ref in API, only one RTC will be supported
   (Affects also define in efm32_cmu.h)
 - Added default init struct macros for LEUART, USART
 - Added msbf parameter in USART synchronous init struct, USART_InitSync_TypeDef.
 - Updated reset for I2C, USART, LEUART to also reset IEN register.
 - Corrected fault in GPIO_PortOutSet()

1.1.2:
 - Corrected minor issues in EMU, EM3 mode when restoring
 - Corrected RMU reset cause checking
 - Changed GPIO enumerator symbols to start with gpio (from GPIO_)
 - Changed CMU and WDOG enum typedefs to start with CMU_/WDOG_ (from cmu/wdog)
 - Added USART/UART, LEUART, DMA, I2C support

1.1.1:
 - First version including support for CMU, DBG, EMU, GPIO, RTC, WDOG
