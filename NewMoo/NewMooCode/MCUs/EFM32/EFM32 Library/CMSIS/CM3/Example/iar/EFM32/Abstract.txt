
This example project uses the EFM32 DSL including
CMSIS and demonstrates the use of Systick in interrupt 
driven mode.

It sets up the USART2 SPI access to DVK registers,
for use MCU-Module's with and without LCD.

Board:  Energy Micro EFM32-Gxxx-DK Development Kit
Device: EFM32G290F128 and EFM32G890F128

-- CMSIS ---------------------------------------------
SystemInit       called from startup_efm32.s
SystemCoreClock  is 14Mhz
SysTick          runs in interrupt mode
