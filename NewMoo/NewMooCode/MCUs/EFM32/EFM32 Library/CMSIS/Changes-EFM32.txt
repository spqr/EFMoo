================ Revision history ============================================
1.3.0:
 - DMA register WAITSTATUS changed to CHWAITSTATUS for consistency
   DMA test req/sreq registers added, CHSREQSTATUS and CHREQSTATUS  
 - IFS and IFC interrupt registers are now marked as readable for several
   peripherals
 - TIMER, CCC renamed to CDTI
 - TIMER, QEM has been renamed to QDM
 - AF_DBG_SWV/TCLK/TDIO renamed to more commonly used AF_DBG_SWD/SWDIO/SWDCLK
 - AF_EBI_ADDRDAT renamed to AF_EBI_AD
 - Removed bit fields for extra LCD segment registers for Gecko parts
 - Fixed LCD_SEGEN_MASK, bit width was too narrow in version 1.2.x
 - Fixed LCD_SYNCBUSY bit fields
 - CMU_PCNTCTRL reset values corrected
 - PCNT_TOP and PCNT_TOPB reset values corrected
 - ADC_LPFMODE_RCFILT and LPFMOD_DECAP definitions corrected (they were 
   reversed)
 - USART_RXDATAFULLRIGHT and USART_RXDATAVRIGHT removed for Gecko parts
 - GPIO, renamed INSENSE_PRSSENSE to INSENSE_PRS, similar for INT
   to be consistent with updated documentation (Reference Manual)

1.2.1:
 - Fixed DEVINFO calibration shift and mask value for temperature sensor
   fixed in rev.C Gecko devices

1.2.0:
 - Added new subgroup "Parts" for all part definitions in doxygen format
 - Removed unused _PARAM_ type definitions, less clutter in header files
 - _CMU_PCNTCTRL_RESETVALUE corrected
 - Added C startup file for IAR, can be used as replacement for assembly file
 - Use #defines instead of "numeric values reentered" in bit field definitions
 - TIMER_PARAM_CCNUM(i) changed to TIMER_PARAM_CC_NUM(i)
 - DPI_CHAN_COUNT changed to PRS_CHAN_COUNT

1.1.4:
 - TIMER_INIT_DEFAULT fix to efm32lib 

1.1.3:
 - Removed ADC ROUTE register
 - Renamed DEVINFO DACCAL  -> DAC0CAL for all 3 calibration registers and bit
   fields
 - Updated efm32lib with new peripherals

1.1.2:
 - Added support for CodeSourcery Sourcery G++ compiler and startup files
 - Device Information page (DEVINFO_TypeDef) - fixed several issues with
   endianness, and other changes to support test revision 4 and above parts.
   This has led to a small incompatibilty with test rev <= 4 and rev A parts,
   in that the flash and sram size bit fields has changed location.
 - DMA_CONTROL_TypeDef changed name to DMA_DESCRIPTOR_TypeDef to be better 
   aligned with PL230 manual and code
 - DMA bit fields not supported on EFM32 was removed for the PL230 controller
 - DMA CTRL bit fields renamed to be more consistent with PL230 TRM manual
 - Added additional volatile statements to pointers in DMA Control structure
 - Fixed several registers that were readable, and was marked as __O (output 
   only)

1.1.1:
 - Fixed startup code, CMSIS SystemInit cannot update global variable

1.1.0:
 - Note - some register bit field updates in this release are _not_ backward 
   compatible
 - Updated register bit fields to comply with documentation updates, i.e. 
   reference manual version > 0.83
 - Apply patch to CMSIS core for GCC issues
 - Added DMA_CONTROL_TypeDef control block for PrimeCell PL230 DMA controller
 - Added ROMTABLE PID / CHIP revision table and masks
 - Revised and updated Device Information page structure "DEVINFO page"
   This structure is ONLY valid for rev.B production devices
 - GPIO EXTIPSEL bit field marked "16" changed to 15 (bug correction) 
 - Added more bit fields to TIMER_ROUTE registers
 - Cosmetic updates in doxygen comments and copyright statements

1.0.4:
 - ACMP INPUTSEL bit fields changed from ohm rating to res-n,
 - Added bit-band base addresses for peripherals and sram

1.0.3:
 - ADC SCANMODE and SCANCTRL bit field updates and corrections
 - Moved Readme.txt and Changes.txt to CMSIS/Readme-EFM32.txt and 
   CMSIS/Changes-EFM32.txt
 - CCPEN and CDTIPEN splitted in TIMER_ROUTE
 - EMVREG in EMU_CTRL enumeration changed
 - LCD DISPCTRL volatage levels are part specific, changed settings changed to 
   reflect this
 - Added "UL" (unsigned long) to some bit fields giving warnings due to sign 
   conversion

1.0.2:
 - Corrected revision numbers in file headers
 - Removed example code that was moved into BSP/DVK installer package

1.0.1:
 - Updated to use official CMSIS1V30 release
 - Corrected IRQ vector table in assembly startup files, IMEM to MSC, 
   UDMA to DMA
 - DMA peripheral/signal names corrected
 - Example Blinky application updated to work on all EFM32 MCU-Modules on DVK
 - Added "simple" board support package to example
 - Added "UL" (unsigned long) tag to several fields

1.0.0: 
 - Initial release
 - Includes CMSIS1V30 2nd PreRelease
 - Now requires two include paths, CMSIS/CM3/DeviceSupport/EnergyMicro/EFM32 and 
   CMSIS/CM3/CoreSupport
